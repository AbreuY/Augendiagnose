	<h2>Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Display Settings</h3>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Last photo is right eye</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default this
				is the left eye (which means that you made first a photo of the right eye and then of the left eye).</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Sort by last name</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you may decide that names are not ordered strictly alphabetically as given,
				but by the last name.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Default overlay color</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can define the default color for iris topography overlays. (Standard: red)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Language</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can change the language in which the app is displayed. A value change
				forces a restart of the app.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Hints</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can re-enable all hints, or you can disable all existing hints (which is
				helpful after new installation if you know the app already).</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h3>Storage and Memory Settings</h3>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Eye Photo Folder</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top"><p>This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos. Normally, you
					need not change this. From here, you can copy the photos to other devices.</p>

				<p>The predefined folder is &ldquo;EyePhotos&rdquo;.</p>

				<p>You can select here a folder either on your device memory or on an SD card. In Android 4.4 (Kitkat), storage
					on SD card has some limitations, therefore some operations will take longer. In Android 5, when selecting a folder
					on SD card, you will have to grant access rights to the SD card via Android&apos;s Storage Access Framework.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Max Bitmap size</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This
				downscaling is required to save device memory. The default value is 2048. In devices with little memory, it may be
				required to configure a smaller value (such as 1024). Too big values may crash the application.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Show image in full resolution</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can decide under which circumstances the photo is displayed in full
				resolution, which allows to see more details on the photo, but consumes memory and computing time.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Always load automatically:</b> The app always stores the photos in full resolution in memory. This
						gives the best user experience on high end devices, but may lead to crashes if there is not enough memory
						available.</li>

					<li><b>Load automatically when displaying single photo:</b> The app shows full resolution only when displaying
						a single image. This requires half of the memory.</li>

					<li><b>Load only on demand:</b> The app does not show the image in full resolution. This requires least memory
						and CPU, but details in the photo may be lost. The &ldquo;magnifier&rdquo; button <img
						src="../drawable/ic_clarity.png" /> allows to display the current picture detail in full resolution.</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Save additional data in jpeg</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

				<ul>
					<li><b>Store in EXIF (recommended):</b> The app stores relevant information in the JPG file, even in standard
						fields which are visible in Windows.</li>

					<li><b>Store in custom fields:</b> The app stores information in the JPG file, but only in separate fields.
						Standard fields remain unchanged; the data exchange with Windows is not possible.</li>

					<li><b>Don&apos;t store data in images:</b> The app does not store information in JPG files. (This limits the
						functionality of the app.)</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h3>Remove Ads / Donate</h3>

	<p>This page offers various buttons by which you can make a donation to the developer - the development of this app
		takes lot of time, therefore it would be good to get something back from the people who find this app useful.</p>

	<p>In addition, there are the following features:</p>

	<table width="100%" border="1">
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Remove Ads</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can disable all ads (currently only in US). This feature can be enabled
				via donation or via user key.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">Contact the developer</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">Here you can send an email to the developer in case you have wishes or problems.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="30%" valign="top">User key</td>
			<td width="70%" valign="top">A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<h2>Organize the photos</h2>

	<p>Here you can organize your eye photos.</p>

	<p>The two last images of the input folder are displayed.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;Switch&rdquo; you can exchange the two photos.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;Other Photos&rdquo;, you can select two different photos from the input folder, by
		clicking on two of the displayed photos. Here, you may also delete photos from the input folder, by using the context
		menu (long click on a photo).</p>

	<p>At &ldquo;Select Name&rdquo; you can set the name of the person from which the eye photos are taken. Here you
		can either select an existing name or enter a new name.</p>

	<p>At &ldquo;Select Date&rdquo; you can select the date on which the photos are listed. Typically this is the
		capture date of the photos, which is preselected. However, you may select a different date. This is necessary in
		particular, if you want to keep more than one eye pair of a person from one date - the app allows only one photo pair
		per day and person.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;OK&rdquo; you can move the selected eye photo pair to the eye photo folder. The photos
		are attached to the given name and date and can then be used by the app.</p>

	<h2>Visualize the photos</h2>

	<p>In this activity, you can select the name of a person whose eye photos you want to see. Then you get shown all
		eye photos of this person in a list sorted by date.</p>

	<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo).</li>

		<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and click on a second photo)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person (via long click) and then select a
			photo of a different person.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos - this allows to compare eye photos
		with iris topography graphics. Such graphics are not included in the app (except as overlays).</p>

	<h3>Further options in the overview</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>When making a long click on a name in the list of names, you may change or delete the name</li>

		<li>When making a long click on a date in the list of pictures for a name, you may change the date or delete the
			pictures of that date, or you may move these pictures back to the input folder (e.g. in order to move them to a
			different name).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Further options in the detail view</h3>

	<p>In the detail view (one or two photos), you have the following further possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Change of brightness and contrast via sliders <img src="../drawable/ic_seek_brightness.png" /><img
			src="../drawable/ic_seek_contrast.png" /></li>

		<li>Display of iris topographies as overlay (numbered buttons), adaption of the overlay to the iris and storage
			of overlay position (lock button <img src="../drawable/ic_lock_open.png" />)
		</li>

		<li>Store the selected settings of brightness and contrast (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; <img
			src="../drawable/ic_action_save.png" /> button on action bar)
		</li>

		<li>Store the position and zoom (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; <img src="../drawable/ic_action_save.png" /> button on
			action bar)
		</li>

		<li>Change the comment of the photo (via &ldquo;document&rdquo; <img src="../drawable/ic_comment.png" /> button
			on action bar)
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		These features may be enabled or disabled via the button &ldquo;Show/Hide utilities&rdquo; <img
			src="../drawable/ic_tools_up.png" />.
