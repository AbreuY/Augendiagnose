<title>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</h2>

	This App has the purpose to support the visualization of eye photographs on an
	Android device, in order to do medical diagnosis.

	<h3>Key Features</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Organization of eye photos by name, date and side (right/left)</li>

		<li>Display of two eye photos in parallel (with full support of
			individual resizing), so that comparisons are possible (such as right-left
			comparison, earlier-later comparison, different person comparison, or
			comparison to an iris topography).</li>

		<li>Change of brightness and contrast of the photo during display, and
			overlay with an iris topography.</li>

		<li>You can also save information in the photos, such as brightness
			adaptions and comments. To be able to store information and use the full
			functionality of the app, you need photos in JPG format.</li>

	</ul>

	This is just a beta version of the app. Further features are to come. Ideas for
	further features are welcome.

	<h3>Main activities</h3>

	<h4>Step 1: Organize the photos.</h4>

	<p>In this step, you can organize eye photos.</p>

	<p>The App expects new eye photos in an input folder which is preconfigured
		as the target folder of the Eye-Fi app, but can be changed via the settings.</p>

	<p>In the &ldquo;Organize new photos&rdquo; activity, you can assign new
		eye photos from the input folder to a person and a date and prepare them in
		this way for the app. Then the photos will be renamed and moved to the eye
		photo folder.</p>

	<p>As an alternative, you may select two photos in a file browser or photo
		app and send these photos to the Eye Diagnosis app. Then you can organize
		these photos in the app. In this case, the photos will not be deleted from
		their old location.</p>

	<h4>Step 2: Visualize the photos.</h4>

	<p>This is the main purpose of the app, but it requires the photos to be
		organized via step 1.</p>

	<p>In this activity, you can</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail. Here you can also change brightness
			and contrast of the photo, show iris topographies as overlay, or write a
			comment to a photo.</li>

		<li>Display two photos for comparison (and pinch them independently).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Data storage</h3>

	<p>The app stores information (like iris position or comments) directly in
		the JPG image files. This has the advantage that all such information is still
		available if you copy the pictures from one device to another one. To some
		extent, information like comments will be even available when viewing the
		files in MS Windows.</p>

	<p>However, this kind of storage imposes a small risk. It may happen that
		on some devices, or for pictures from some cameras, storage of information in
		the JPG fails, or possibly even destroys the JPG file. Therefore, it is
		recommended that you keep backups of your JPG files at least when using the
		app for the first time with a new device or with a new camera.</p>

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Settings</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Input folder for new eye photos</h3>

	<p>This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this is either the target folder of
		the Eye-Fi app or the standard folder of the Camera app. However, you can configure here any other folder.</p>

	<p>Background regarding the Eye-Fi app: typically, the camera of the mobile device is not sufficient to capture eye
		photos in high quality. A more practical approach is to use an external camera with Eye-Fi SD card, which transfers
		the photos via WLAN to the mobile device.</p>

	<h3>Eye Photo Folder</h3>

	<p>This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos. Normally, you need not change this. From here, you
		can copy the photos to other devices.</p>

	<p>The predefined folder is &ldquo;EyePhotos&rdquo;.</p>

	<p>You can select here a folder either on your device memory or on an SD card. In Android 4.4 (Kitkat), storage on
		SD card has some limitations, therefore some operations will take longer.</p>

	<h3>Last photo is right eye</h3>

	Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default this is the left eye (which means that
	you made first a photo of the right eye and then of the left eye).

	<h3>Sort by last name</h3>

	Here you may decide that names are not ordered strictly alphabetically as given, but by the last name.

	<h3>Max Bitmap size</h3>

	This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This downscaling is required to save device memory.
	The default value is 2048. In devices with little memory, it may be required to configure a smaller value (such as
	1024). Too big values may crash the application.

	<h3>Show image in full resolution</h3>

	Here you can decide under which circumstances the photo is displayed in full resolution, which allows to see more
	details on the photo, but consumes memory and computing time.

	<ul>
		<li>Always load automatically: The app always stores the photos in full resolution in memory. This gives the best
			user experience on high end devices, but may lead to crashes if there is not enough memory available.</li>

		<li>Load automatically when displaying single photo: The app shows full resolution only when displaying a single
			image. This requires half of the memory.</li>

		<li>Load only on demand: The app does not show the image in full resolution. This requires least memory and CPU,
			but details in the photo may be lost. The &ldquo;magnifier&rdquo; button allows to display the current picture detail
			in full resolution.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Save additional data in jpeg</h3>

	Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

	<ul>
		<li>Store in EXIF (recommended): The app stores relevant information in the JPG file, even in standard fields
			which are visible in Windows.</li>

		<li>Store in custom fields: The app stores information in the JPG file, but only in separate fields. Standard
			fields remain unchanged; the data exchange with Windows is not possible.</li>

		<li>Don&amp;apos;t store data in images: The app does not store information in JPG files. (This limits the
			functionality of the app.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Default overlay color</h3>

	Here you can define the default color for iris topography overlays. (Standard: red)

	<h3>Language</h3>

	Here you can change the language in which the app is displayed. A value change forces a restart of the app.

	<h3>User key</h3>

	A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Organize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Organize the photos</h2>

	<p>Here you can organize your eye photos.</p>

	<p>The two last images of the input folder are displayed.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;Switch&rdquo; you can exchange the two photos.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;Other Photos&rdquo;, you can select two different photos from the input folder, by
		clicking on two of the displayed photos. Here, you may also delete photos from the input folder, by using the context
		menu (long click on a photo).</p>

	<p>At &ldquo;Select Name&rdquo; you can set the name of the person from which the eye photos are taken. Here you
		can either select an existing name or enter a new name.</p>

	<p>At &ldquo;Select Date&rdquo; you can select the date on which the photos are listed. Typically this is the
		capture date of the photos, which is preselected. However, you may select a different date. This is necessary in
		particular, if you want to keep more than one eye pair of a person from one date - the app allows only one photo pair
		per day and person.</p>

	<p>With the button &ldquo;OK&rdquo; you can move the selected eye photo pair to the eye photo folder. The photos
		are attached to the given name and date and can then be used by the app.</p>

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Visualize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Visualize the photos</h2>

	<p>In this activity, you can select the name of a person whose eye photos you want to see. Then you get shown all
		eye photos of this person in a list sorted by date.</p>

	<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo).</li>

		<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and click on a second photo)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person (via long click) and then select a
			photo of a different person.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos - this allows to compare eye photos
		with iris topography graphics. Such graphics are not included in the app (except as overlays).</p>

	<h3>Further options in the overview</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>When making a long click on a name in the list of names, you may change or delete the name</li>

		<li>When making a long click on a date in the list of pictures for a name, you may change the date or delete the
			pictures of that date, or you may move these pictures back to the input folder (e.g. in order to move them to a
			different name).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Further options in the detail view</h3>

	<p>In the detail view (one or two photos), you have the following further possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Change of brightness and contrast via sliders</li>

		<li>Display of iris topographies as overlay, adaption of the overlay to the iris and storage of overlay position
			(lock button)</li>

		<li>Store the selected settings of brightness and contrast (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; button on action bar)</li>

		<li>Store the position and zoom (via &ldquo;save&rdquo; button on action bar)</li>

		<li>Change the comment of the photo (via &ldquo;document&rdquo; button on action bar)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These features may be enabled or disabled via the context menu (long click on photo) at &ldquo;Show/Hide
		utilities&rdquo;.</p>
