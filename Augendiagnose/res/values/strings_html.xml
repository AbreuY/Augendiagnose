<title>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</h2>

	This App has the purpose to support the visualization of eye photographs on an
	Android device, in order to do medical diagnosis.

	<h3>Key Features</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Organization of eye photos by name, date and side (right/left)</li>

		<li>Display of two eye photos in parallel (with full support of
			individual resizing), so that comparisons are possible (such as right-left
			comparison, earlier-later comparison, different person comparison, or
			comparison to an iris topography).</li>

		<li>Change of brightness and contrast of the photo during display, and
			overlay with an iris topography.</li>
	</ul>

	This is just an alpha version of the app. Further features are to come. Ideas
	for further features are welcome.

	<h3>Main activities</h3>

	<h4>Step 1: Organize the photos.</h4>

	<p>In this step, you can organize eye photos.</p>

	<p>The App expects new eye photos in an input folder which is preconfigued
		as the target folder of the Eye-Fi app, but can be changed via the settings.</p>

	<p>In the &quot;Organize new photos&quot; activity, you can assign new eye
		photos from the input folder to a person and a date and prepare them in this
		way for the app. Then the photos will be renamed and moved to the eye photo
		folder.</p>

	<p>As an alternative, you may select two photos in a file browser or photo
		app and send these photos to the Eye Diagnosis app. Then you can organize
		these photos in the app. In this case, the photos will not be deleted from
		their old location.</p>

	<h4>Step 2: Visualize the photos.</h4>

	<p>This is the main purpose of the app, but it requires the photos to be
		organized via step 1.</p>

	<p>In this activity, you can</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail. Here you can also change brightness
			and contrast of the photo, show iris topographies as overlay, or write a
			comment to a photo.</li>

		<li>Display two photos for comparison (and pinch them independently).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Data storage</h3>

	<p>The app stores information (like iris position or comments) directly in
		the JPG image files. This has the advantage that all such information is still
		available if you copy the pictures from one device to another one. To some
		extent, information like comments will be even available when viewing the
		files in MS Windows.</p>

	<p>However, this kind of storage imposes a small risk. It may happen that
		on some devices, or for pictures from some cameras, it may happen that storing
		information in the JPG fails, or possibly even destroys the JPG file.
		Therefore, it is recommended that you keep backups of your JPG files at least
		when using the app for the first time with a new device or with a new camera.</p>

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Settings</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Input folder for new eye photos</h3>

	This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this
	is the target folder of the Eye-Fi app. However, you can configure here any
	other folder, such as the camera folder.

	<p>This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By
		default, this is either the target folder of the Eye-Fi app or the standard
		folder of the Camera app. However, you can configure here any other folder,
		such as the camera folder.</p>

	<p>Background regarding the Eye-Fi app: typically, the camera of the mobile
		device is not sufficient to capture eye photos in high quality. A more
		practical approach is to use an external camera which Eye-Fi SD card, which
		transfers the photos via WLAN to the mobile device.</p>

	<h3>Eye Photo Folder</h3>

	This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos. Normally, you need
	not change this. From here, you can copy the photos to other devices.

	<h3>Max Bitmap size</h3>

	This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This
	downscaling is required to save device memory. The default value is 2048. In
	devices with little memory, it may be required to configure a smaller value
	(such as 1024). Too big values may crash the application.

	<h3>Last photo is right eye</h3>

	Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default
	this is the left eye (which means that you made first a photo of the right eye
	and then of the left eye).

	<h3>Save additional data in jpeg</h3>

	Here you can limit the storage of data in the JPG files by the app.

	<ul>
		<li>Store in EXIF (recommended): The app stores relevant information in
			the JPG file, even in standard fields which are visible in Windows.</li>

		<li>Store in custom fields: The app stores information in the JPG file,
			but only in separate fields. Standard fields remain unchanged; the data
			exchange with Windows is not possible.</li>

		<li>Don&amp;apos;t store data in images: The app does not store
			information in JPG files. (This limits the functionality of the app.)</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>User key</h3>

	A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Organize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Organize the photos</h2>

	<p>Here you can organize your eye photos.</p>

	<p>The two last steps of the input folder are displayed.</p>

	<p>With the button &quot;Switch&quot; you can exchange the two photos.</p>

	<p>With the button &quot;Other Photos&quot;, you can select two different
		photos from the input folder.</p>

	<p>At &quot;Select Name&quot; you can set the name of the person from which
		the eye photos are taken. Here you can either select an existing name or enter
		a new name.</p>

	<p>At &quot;Select Date&quot; you can select the date on which the photos
		are listed. Typically this is the capture date of the photos, which is
		preselected. However, you may select a different date. This is necessary in
		particular, if you want to keep more than one eye pair of a person from one
		date - the app allows only one photo pair per day and person.</p>

	<p>With the buton &quot;OK&quot; you can move the selected eye photo pair
		to the eye photo folder. The photos are attached to the given name and date
		and can then be used by the app.</p>

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Visualize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Visualize the photos</h2>

	<p>In this activity, you can select the name of a person whose eye photos
		you want to see. Then you get shown all eye photos of this person in a list
		sorted by date.</p>

	<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo).</li>

		<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and
			click on a second photo)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person
			(via long click) and then select a photo of a different person for
			comparison.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos
		- this allows to compare eye photos with iris topography graphics. Such
		graphics are not included in the app due to copyright reasons.</p>

	<h3>Further options in the overview</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>When making a long click on a name in the list of names, you may
			change or delete the name</li>

		<li>When making a long click on a date in the list of pictures for a
			name, you may change the date or delete the pictures of that date.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Further options in the detail view</h3>

	<p>In the detail view (one or two photos), you have the following further
		possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Change of brightness and contrast via sliders</li>

		<li>Display of iris topographies as overlay, adaption of the overlay to
			the iris and storage of overlay position (lock button)</li>

		<li>Store the selected settings of brightness and contrast (via context
			menu - long click on photo)</li>

		<li>Store the position and zoom (via context menu)</li>

		<li>Change the comment of the photo (via context menu)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These features may be enabled or disabled via the context menu (long
		click on photo) at &quot;Show/Hide utilities&quot;.</p>
