<title>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Overview</h2>

	This App has the purpose to support the visualization of eye photographs on an
	Android device, in order to do medical diagnosis.

	<h3>Key Features</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Organization of eye photos by name, date and side (right/left)</li>

		<li>Display of two eye photos in parallel (with full support of
			individual resizing), so that comparisons are possible (such as right-left
			comparison, earlier-later comparison, different person comparison, or
			comparison to an iris topography).</li>

		<li>Change of brightness and contrast of the photo during display, and
			overlay with an iris topography.</li>
	</ul>

	This is just an alpha version of the app. Further features are to come. Ideas
	for further features are welcome.

	<h3>Main activities</h3>

	<h4>Step 1: Organize the photos.</h4>

	<p>In this step, you can organize eye photos.</p>

	<p>The App expects new eye photos in an input folder which is preconfigued
		as the target folder of the Eye-Fi app, but can be changed via the settings.</p>

	<p>In the "Organize new photos" activity, you can assign new eye photos
		from the input folder to a person and a date and prepare them in this way for
		the app. Then the photos will be renamed and moved to the eye photo folder.</p>

	<p>As an alternative, you may select two photos in a file browser or photo
		app and send these photos to the Eye Diagnosis app. Then you can organize
		these photos in the app. In this case, the photos will not be deleted from
		their old location.</p>

	<h4>Step 2: Visualize the photos.</h4>

	<p>This is the main purpose of the app, but it requires the photos to be
		organized via step 1.</p>

	<p>In this activity, you can</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail. Here you can also change brightness
			and contrast of the photo or show iris topographies as overlay.</li>

		<li>Display two photos for comparison (and pinch them independently).</li>
	</ul>

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Settings</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Eye Diagnosis - Settings</h2>

	The application allows the following settings:

	<h3>Eye Photo Folder</h3>

	This is the folder in which the app manages the eye photos.

	<h3>Input folder for new eye photos</h3>

	This is the folder, from which the app imports new eye photos. By default, this
	is the EyeFi folder. However, you can configure here any other folder, such as
	the camera folder.

	<h3>Max Bitmap size</h3>

	This is the size to which photos are scaled down before displaying. This
	downscaling is required to save device memory. The default value is 2048. In
	devices with little memory, it may be required to configure a smaller value
	(such as 1024). Too big values may crash the application.

	<h3>Last photo is right eye</h3>

	Here you can define if the last photo is the right or the left eye. By default
	this is the left eye (which means that you made first a photo of the right eye
	and then of the left eye).

	<h3>User key</h3>

	A user key that allows unlocking of additional functionality.

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Organize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Organize the photos</h2>

	<p>Here you can organize your eye photos.</p>

	<p>The two last steps of the input folder are displayed.</p>

	<p>With the button "Switch" you can exchange the two photos.</p>

	<p>With the button "Other Photos", you can select two different photos from the input folder.</p>

	<p>At "Select Name" you can set the name of the person from which the eye photos are taken.
	Here you can either select an existing name or enter a new name.</p>

	<p>At "Select Date" you can select the date on which the photos are listed.
	Typically this is the capture date of the photos, which is preselected. However, you may
	select a different date. This is necessary in particular, if you want to keep more than one eye pair
	of a person from one date - the app allows only one photo pair per day and person.</p>

	<p>With the buton "OK" you can move the selected eye photo pair to the eye photo folder.
	The photos are attached to the given name and date and can then be used by the app.</p>

<title>Eye Diagnosis - Visualize Photos</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h2>Visualize the photos</h2>

	<p>In this activity, you can select the name of a person whose eye photos
		you want to see. Then you get shown all eye photos of this person in a list
		sorted by date.</p>

	<p>Then you have the following possibilities:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Show one of the photos in detail (via click on a photo). In this view
			you may also change brightness and contrast of the photo or show iris
			topographies as overlay. (Note: due to copyright, there are currently only
			two self-made iris topographies delivered with the app.)</li>

		<li>Show both photos of one date (via click on a date)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different dates (via long click on one photo and
			click on a second photo)</li>

		<li>Show two photos of different persons: Select one photo of this person
			(via long click) and then select a photo of a different person for
			comparison.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Note that iris topography graphics may be organized just like eye photos
		- this allows to compare eye photos with iris topography graphics. Such
		graphics are not included in the app due to copyright reasons.</p>
